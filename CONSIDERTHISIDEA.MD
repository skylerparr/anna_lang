Consider this:

What if every being on this planet is you? But, you can only experience
it one being at a time. Every time you die, you are just reborn as a new
being on this planet. You get to live all the endless possibilities
of every being of every time that will ever exist on this planet.
Your life will overlap and you meet yourself living a different life
at the same time. You will be friends with yourself, you will work
with yourself, you will even love yourself just as your partners and 
family love you now. You will love yourself unconditionally. You will
live your life as Martin Luther King, Jr., Oprah Winfrey, Abraham
Lincoln, Ghandi, a tiger, a dog, a whale, everything. You will be all knowing 
and ever present. You will live every experience
from every perspective. With all its love and all its pain. Think of this
whenever you see a suffering animal or human being. That is you 
experiencing that pain. That heart break is yours, that loss is yours, 
that sexism, racism, joy, humility, strife, is yours. So, treat every being
with kindness and love, because you will have to experience it someday.
